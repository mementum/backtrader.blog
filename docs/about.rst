About backtrader
================

First question. What is ``backtrader``?

  - A backtesting platform to obviously perform backtesting of your trading ideas

The major goal

  - Ease of use for anyone, be it to test a strategy or develop indicators

One of the questions often asked by friends is

  - Why? Is there no other platform which can do it?

Indeed! But as I do usually answer:

  - I do it because I can

A more comprehensive answer would include:

  #. Control of indicator developpment

     After using several platforms and having played with my own toy indicators
     I have always hitting errors, lack of documentation and difficulties in
     developing simple concepts given the major overhead imposed by the
     platforms, be it because of the language, the facilities or both

  #. Broker simulation

     I have seen many and I wasn't happy with the outcome. This is still a
     major area with room for improvement in ``backtrader`` itself, but the
     results are quite good.

  #. Doing it in Python

     Although some others like ``pyalgotrade`` do exists I wasn't happy when
     trying to do something with them. Possibly a lot

Documentation
=============

A somehow complete (probably with errors) documentation is available at:
