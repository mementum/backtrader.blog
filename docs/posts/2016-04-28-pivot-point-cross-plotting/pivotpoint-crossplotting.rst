Pivot Point and Cross Plotting
##############################

An interesting request came across:

  - PivotPoint

It is interesting because of how the indicator is defined. Literature can be
found at `PivotPoint at StockCharts
<http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:pivot_points>`_.
PivotPoints use the ``close``, ``high`` and ``low`` prices of a past
timeframe. For example for the daily timeframe:

  - *Pivot Points for daily charts use the prior month's data*

This may seem troublesome because for each timeframe there needs to be a
definition of what other timeframe has to be used. Looking at the formulas
opens up another question::

  Pivot Point (P) = (High + Low + Close)/3
  Support 1 (S1) = (P x 2) - High
  Support 2 (S2) = P  -  (High  -  Low)
  Resistance 1 (R1) = (P x 2) - Low
  Resistance 2 (R2) = P + (High  -  Low)

Even if the text is full of references to *prior period* and *past ...* the
formulas seem to reference the current point in time. Let's follow the advice
of the *text* and use *previous* in our first attempt at the PivotPoint. But
first let's tackle the problem of the different timeframes by doing this:

  - The indicator will not tackle the problem

Although this may seem confusing, one has to take into account that
*indicators* have to remain as stupid as possible and be made up of actual
formulas. The problem will be solved as follows::

  data = btfeeds.ADataFeed(..., timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Days)
  cerebro.adddata(data)
  cerebro.resampledata(data, timeframe=bt.TimeFrame.Months)

And later in the *Strategy*::

  class MyStrategy(bt.Strategy):
      def __init__(self):
          self.pp = PivotPoint(self.data1)  # the resampled data

Now it's clear. The system will have the data, plus an extra input resampled to
the needed timeframe. And the ``PivotPoint`` indicator will work with the
resampled data, which is already in the needed *monthly* timeframe for the
original data timeframe which is *daily*.

The indicator can be developed. Let's start by following the text indications
and not the formulas and look back 1 period.

.. literalinclude:: ./pivotpoint.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 27-44

The strategy will look at parameter ``usepp1`` to use this ``PivotPoint1``

.. literalinclude:: ./ppsample.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 37-42

And the output is controlled by a simple ``next`` method

.. literalinclude:: ./ppsample.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 46-55

Let's execute::

  ./ppsample --usepp1

And the output::

  0041,0041,0002,2005-02-28,2962.79
  0042,0042,0002,2005-03-01,2962.79
  ...

Immediately something is clear: *index 41 already belongs to the 2nd
month*. That means we have skipped calculation of the indicator by 1 month. It
is now clear why the text in *StockCharts* is always mentioning that the
calculation happens with the previous *month* but the formulas seem to
reference the current moment.

  - The developers probably faced the same design decisions with multiple datas
    with multiple timeframes.

    At the current *daily* point, only the *closed* bar from the previous
    *month* can be delivered.

That's why the ``next`` method is looking at index ``[0]``. All this has a very
easy fix and that's writing the formulas just like *StockCharts* documents them.

.. literalinclude:: ./pivotpoint.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 46-64

An execution without ``usepp1``::

  ./ppsample

And the new output is::

  0021,0021,0001,2005-01-31,2962.79
  0022,0022,0001,2005-02-01,2962.79
  ...


Et voil√°! The 1st month had ``20`` trading days and once complete the indicator
has calculated the values and can be delivered. The only printed line is ``p``
and if the value is the same in the 2 lines is because the value remains fixed
for the entire next month. Quoting *StockCharts*::

  Once Pivot Points are set, they do not change and remain in play throughout ...

The indicator can already be used. Let's go for plotting. A plotting parameter
has already been set

.. literalinclude:: ./pivotpoint.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 48-49

The calculated values are in line with the data scale and just like a *Moving
Average* it can be plotted along the data (hence ``subplot=False``)

An execution with ``--plot``::

  ./ppsample --plot

.. thumbnail:: pivotpoint-on-monthly-data.png

The blistering barnacles are attacking again. The indicator has been plotted on
the monthly data (its source), which gives no visual indication on the daily
chart, where it would be really helpful.

But ``backtrader`` supports cross-plotting from one data to another. Although
a small addition in ``1.2.8.88`` was needed to support cross-plotting to a data
of a different timeframe.

This is achieved by having ``plotmaster`` say which the plot target is, by
adding it to the ``plotinfo`` attribute of the indicator::

  ./ppsample --plot --plot-on-daily

.. thumbnail:: pivotpoint-on-daily-data.png

The visual feedback is now useful to understand what ``PivotPoint`` is offering.


Script Code and Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Available as sample in the sources of ``backtrader``::

  $ ./ppsample.py --help
  usage: ppsample.py [-h] [--data DATA] [--usepp1] [--plot] [--plot-on-daily]

  Sample for pivot point and cross plotting

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help       show this help message and exit
    --data DATA      Data to be read in (default:
                     ../../datas/2005-2006-day-001.txt)
    --usepp1         Have PivotPoint look 1 period backwards (default: False)
    --plot           Plot the result (default: False)
    --plot-on-daily  Plot the indicator on the daily data (default: False)
